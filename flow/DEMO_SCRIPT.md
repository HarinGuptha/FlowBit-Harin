# üé¨ FlowBit LangFlow Integration - Demo Script

## üéØ Assignment Overview (30 seconds)

> "I've implemented the FlowBit LangFlow integration assignment with all four required capabilities:
> - **Capability A**: Recreated all 4 agents (Email, JSON, PDF, Classifier) in LangFlow format
> - **Capability B**: Full FlowBit integration with sidebar visibility and execution tracking  
> - **Capability C**: Three trigger types - Manual, Webhook, and Cron scheduling
> - **Capability D**: Real-time step-level logs using Server-Sent Events streaming"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Demo (1 minute)

### Show the System Components:
1. **Open browser to:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Point to sidebar:** "Here are the 4 LangFlow agents I recreated"
3. **Show executions table:** "All agents appear with LangFlow engine badges"
4. **Explain:** "The system uses Docker Compose with LangFlow, Redis, and auto-imports flows from the flows/ directory"

## ü§ñ Agent Capabilities Demo (2 minutes)

### Email Agent - End-to-End Example:
> "Let me show you a real example: an angry customer sends an email about a defective product. Watch the complete AI decision-making process."

**Steps:**
1. **Click "Trigger"** on Email Agent
2. **Select "Manual" tab**
3. **Paste this angry email:**
```
From: sarah.johnson@email.com
To: support@company.com
Subject: URGENT - Defective Product Complaint - Order #12345

I am EXTREMELY disappointed and frustrated with the product I received!

The laptop I ordered (Order #12345) arrived with a cracked screen and won't even turn on. This is completely unacceptable for a $1,200 purchase. I've been a loyal customer for 3 years, and this is the worst experience I've ever had.

I need this resolved IMMEDIATELY as I need the laptop for work. I expect:
1. A full refund OR immediate replacement
2. Compensation for the inconvenience
3. An explanation of how this happened

If this isn't resolved within 24 hours, I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and posting negative reviews everywhere.

This is absolutely ridiculous!

4. **Click "Trigger Now"**
5. **Go back to dashboard, click "View"** on the new execution
6. **Click "Message Logs" tab**

### Explain the Results:
> "Watch the real-time processing:
> - **Classifier identifies** it as a complaint with 94% confidence
> - **Email agent detects** angry tone (-0.87 sentiment) and critical urgency  
> - **Action router triggers** three automated actions:
>   - Critical escalation ticket (ESC-2025-001) with 2-hour SLA
>   - CRM update flagging urgent resolution needed
>   - Quality alert for shipping damage pattern
> 
> This demonstrates sophisticated AI coordination with contextual decision-making."

## üîó Trigger Types Demo (1.5 minutes)

### Manual Trigger:
> "You just saw manual triggering with custom input data"

### Webhook Trigger:
1. **Click "Trigger"** on any agent
2. **Select "Webhook" tab**
3. **Show the copyable URL**
4. **Explain:** "This creates public webhook endpoints that external systems can call"

### Cron Scheduling:
1. **Select "Schedule" tab**
2. **Show cron expression:** `0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays at 9 AM)
3. **Add description:** "Daily content classification"
4. **Explain:** "Persistent scheduling with node-cron, survives container restarts"

## üìä Observability Demo (1 minute)

### Health & Stats Endpoints:
1. **Open new tab:** http://localhost:3000/api/health
2. **Show:** "Real-time system health, agent status, service connectivity"
3. **Open:** http://localhost:3000/api/stats  
4. **Show:** "Execution counts, anomaly detection metrics, compliance tracking"

### Explain:
> "The system tracks metrics like agent health, execution counts, and compliance flags. This is essential for observability in production environments."

## üéØ Real-time Logs Demo (1 minute)

### SSE Streaming:
1. **Go back to execution details**
2. **Show "Message Logs" tab**
3. **Explain:** "Server-Sent Events provide real-time log streaming with node-level details"
4. **Point out:** "Each step shows the AI reasoning process - parsing, analysis, action routing"

## üèÜ Technical Highlights (1 minute)

### Professional Architecture:
> "Key technical features that make this production-ready:
> - **Fault tolerance**: Graceful fallbacks when external services are unavailable
> - **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful error messages  
> - **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
> - **Modern UI**: shadcn/ui components with responsive design
> - **API design**: RESTful endpoints following Next.js 13+ app router patterns
> - **Real-time features**: SSE streaming for live updates"

## üìÅ Code Quality Demo (30 seconds)

### Show File Structure:
> "The implementation follows best practices:
> - **flows/**: 4 sophisticated LangFlow agent definitions
> - **app/api/**: All required API routes (runs, streaming, webhooks, cron)
> - **components/**: Reusable UI components with proper separation
> - **lib/**: Utility functions and cron management
> - **Docker setup**: Complete containerization with auto-import"
