Subject: URGENT - Defective Product Complaint - Order #12345
Date: Mon, 6 Jan 2025 14:30:00 +0000

I am EXTREMELY disappointed and frustrated with the product I received!

The laptop I ordered (Order #12345) arrived with a cracked screen and won't even turn on. This is completely unacceptable for a $1,200 purchase. I've been a loyal customer for 3 years, and this is the worst experience I've ever had.

I need this resolved IMMEDIATELY as I need the laptop for work. I expect:
1. A full refund OR immediate replacement
2. Compensation for the inconvenience
3. An explanation of how this happened

If this isn't resolved within 24 hours, I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and posting negative reviews everywhere.

This is absolutely ridiculous!
