Subject: URGENT - Defective Product - DEMAND REFUND!!!
Date: Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:30:00 +0000

I am absolutely FURIOUS about the defective product I received last week!

This is completely UNACCEPTABLE. The item was broken when it arrived, 
and your customer service has been absolutely USELESS. I've been a loyal 
customer for 5 years and this is how you treat me?

I DEMAND an immediate full refund or I will:
1. Contact my lawyer and pursue legal action
2. Report you to the Better Business Bureau  
3. Post negative reviews on every platform
4. Dispute the charge with my credit card company
5. Contact the media about your terrible service

Order ID: ORD-2024-12345
Amount: $299.99
Phone: (555) 123-4567
Account: ACCT-789456

This needs to be resolved TODAY or you'll be hearing from my attorney!
I expect a call from your manager within 2 hours or I'm escalating this
to corporate headquarters.

Extremely disappointed and angry,
Sarah Johnson
